# AI Code Cleanliness and Commenting Rules

**AI Assistant Instructions:** When proposing code edits or generating new code, strictly adhere to the following:

1.  **Delete, Don't Comment Out:** AI Assistant MUST delete unused or replaced code entirely. NEVER leave old code commented out in the final proposed code change. **If unsure whether code is truly unused (e.g., potential side effects, complex interactions), ask for clarification before deleting.**

2.  **Comment Purposefully (Explain ONLY Why, Not What):**
    *   Comments MUST focus **exclusively** on explaining the *reasoning* ('why') behind complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or potential edge cases/consequences.
    *   NEVER add comments that describe *what* the code does, even for organizational purposes (e.g., `// Get references`, `/* Styling for X */`). Rely on clear code structure, function/variable naming instead. **If unsure whether a comment explaining 'why' is needed, ask for guidance.**
    *   NEVER add meta-comments describing the edit action itself (e.g., "// Refactored this", "// Added CSS rule").

3.  **Ensure Readability:** Prioritize self-documenting code through clear naming and logic. Ensure any necessary 'why' comments enhance clarity for human developers.

4.  **Clean Up:** Remove TODOs or placeholder comments when the corresponding task is completed.

5.  **Final Review:** Before submitting the code change proposal, AI Assistant MUST perform a final review pass on the generated/edited code specifically to:
    *   Confirm **all** commented-out legacy/replaced code has been deleted (Rule #1).
    *   Confirm **all** comments describing 'what' the code does or the edit itself have been removed (Rule #2).

**Goal:** The final code produced by the AI should be clean, free of commented-out legacy code, and contain only comments that add essential context ('why'). **Efficiency is gained by avoiding unnecessary comments and legacy code, but correctness takes precedence; seek clarification when deletion or commenting decisions are ambiguous.**
