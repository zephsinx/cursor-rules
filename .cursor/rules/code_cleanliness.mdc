# AI code editing rules for clean code and comments

**AI Assistant Instructions:** When editing or generating code, strictly adhere to the following:

1. **Delete, Don't Comment Out:** AI Assistant MUST delete unused or replaced code entirely. NEVER leave old code commented out in the final proposed code change. **If unsure whether code is truly unused (e.g., potential side effects, complex interactions), ask for clarification before deleting.**

2. **Comment Purposefully (Explain Why, Not What):**
    * AI Assistant comments MUST focus on explaining the *reasoning* behind complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or potential edge cases/consequences.
    * NEVER add comments that merely describe *what* the code does if its function is clear from the code itself (e.g., naming, standard patterns). **If unsure whether a comment explaining 'what' is necessary for clarity in a specific complex situation, err on the side of omitting it or ask for guidance.**
    * NEVER add meta-comments describing the edit action itself (e.g., "// Refactored this", "// Fixed bug", "// Added CSS rule"). The commit message serves this purpose.

3. **Ensure Readability:** While adhering to the above, ensure the final code (including necessary comments explaining the 'why') is clear and understandable for human developers. Prioritize self-documenting code through clear naming and logic.

4. **Clean Up:** Remove TODOs or placeholder comments when the corresponding task is completed.

**Goal:** The final code produced by the AI should be clean, free of commented-out legacy code, and contain only comments that add essential context for future readers, not comments explaining the edit process. **Efficiency is gained by avoiding unnecessary comments and legacy code, but correctness (not deleting vital code or omitting critical explanations) takes precedence; seek clarification when deletion or commenting decisions are ambiguous.**
