# AI Rule: Creating Effective Cursor Rules

**AI Assistant Instructions:** When asked to create or modify a Cursor rule file (`.mdc`), ensure the following structure and best practices are followed:

**If the user's request for the rule is ambiguous regarding type, scope, or specific instructions, MUST ask for clarification before proceeding.**

## 1. Frontmatter Configuration

All Cursor rules MUST have YAML frontmatter containing `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` fields. Configure these fields **exactly** according to the intended rule type (determined from user request or rule purpose):

*   **`Always` Rules:**
    *   `description: `
    *   `globs: `
    *   `alwaysApply: true`

*   **`Auto Attached` Rules:**
    *   `description: `
    *   `globs: ["**/pattern1/*.ts", "**/pattern2/*.js"]` (Use specific patterns)
    *   `alwaysApply: false`

*   **`Agent Requested` Rules:**
    *   `description: "USE WHEN [Concise, keyword-rich summary (max ~120 chars)]"` (Must start with 'USE WHEN')
    *   `globs: `
    *   `alwaysApply: false`

*   **`Manual` Rules:**
    *   `description: `
    *   `globs: `
    *   `alwaysApply: false`

## 2. Rule Body Best Practices

The rule body MUST contain clear, actionable instructions for the AI assistant that will *use* the rule later:

*   **Use Imperative Language:** Employ strong directives (`MUST`, `NEVER`, `SHOULD`, `AVOID`, `PREFER`, `ENSURE`).
*   **Be Specific & Unambiguous:** Define standards precisely. Avoid vague terms.
*   **Focus on Actionable Steps:** Frame guidelines as tasks the AI can perform or checks it can make.
*   **Provide Brief Context (Why):** Explain the reasoning *briefly* if it clarifies the instruction.
*   **Use Markdown Formatting:** Leverage headings, lists, and bold text for clarity.
*   **Address Ambiguity (for Target AI):** If the rule being created involves potential uncertainty for the target AI, include guidance on how it should seek clarification (e.g., "If unsure..., ask user...").
*   **Keep it Concise:** Avoid unnecessary jargon or verbosity.
*   **No Meta-Comments:** Do not include comments *within the rule being created* about the act of creating it.

**Goal:** To generate rule files that are correctly configured according to their type and contain clear, specific, actionable instructions that effectively guide AI behavior according to the user's intent and project standards.
